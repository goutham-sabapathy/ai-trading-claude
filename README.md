## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubair-trabzada/ai-trading-claude/main/install.sh | bash
```

That's it. One command installs all 16 skills, 5 agents, and the PDF generation scripts.

## What Is This?

AI Trading Analyst is a **research and analysis tool** built as Claude Code skills. It is **not** a trading bot. It does **not** connect to brokerages. It does **not** execute trades.

What it does: takes a ticker symbol and runs a comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis using 5 parallel AI agents — technical, fundamental, sentiment, risk, and thesis — then produces a composite Trade Score (0-100) with a clear signal (Strong Buy / Buy / Hold / Caution / Avoid).

Run `/trade analyze AAPL` and 5 AI agents launch in parallel to produce a complete investment research report.

No API keys. No brokerage accounts. No financial data subscriptions. Just Claude Code.

## Changelog

### v1.1.0 — 2026-05-13 — Backtest, Sector Correlation, Position Awareness

Major enhancements to four core skills (`trade-earnings`, `trade-options`, `trade-watchlist`, `trade-analyze`) motivated by gaps identified in real-world usage. **+192 lines added** across the skill toolkit.

**`trade-earnings`** — Mandatory 8-quarter backtest and structural pattern detection:
- New **8-quarter historical table** with mandatory `Beat Implied?` column (✅ if actual > implied, ❌ otherwise) — drives long-vs-short premium decision
- New **Phase 3.5: Strategy Backtest table** — computes win rate for Iron Condor / Bull Put / Bear Call / Long Straddle / Long Call / Long Put across last 8 quarters at 1σ strikes
- New **Phase 6.5: Sector Read-Through Check** — flags correlated tickers reporting within ±3 days
- Required metrics: **Direction Bias %** (% of last 8Q UP) and **Beat-Implied Rate %** — leads recommendations with highest historical PoP play instead of defaulting to "high IV = sell premium"
- Pre-recommendation user-position check (TRADE-WATCHLIST.md or direct ask)

**`trade-options`** — Override rules and pre-trade verification:
- **CRITICAL Pre-Recommendation Checks**: existing positions, nearby catalysts, multi-source IV verification, historical strategy backtest
- New **decision tree**: Direction Bias → Beat-Implied Rate → IV context (not the reverse)
- Explicit override rule for "high IV = sell premium" when historical pattern dictates (e.g., AMAT exceeded implied 6/8 quarters → long premium edge despite IV Rank 84)
- Quality standards 6.5-6.7: cross-source IV, position check, sector correlation

**`trade-watchlist`** — Calendar conflict detection:
- New **Alert Type 8**: Sector Read-Through Conflict (auto-flag tickers reporting within ±3 days of each other)
- New **Alert Type 9**: User Options Position Exposed (catalyst within DTE window)
- New **Alert Type 10**: Macro Event Conflict (FOMC/CPI/PPI within ±3 days)
- Defined sector baskets (AI Semis, Mega-cap Tech, Storage, Data/AI Software, AI Compute)
- Rules 11-14: day-of-week verification for expirations, read-through checks, macro conflicts, options position tagging

**`trade-analyze`** — Sector context in Risk Assessment:
- Risk Assessment (Agent 4) now requires: sector-leader correlation, sector earnings calendar (±14 days), macro event proximity

**Motivating real-world gaps** that v1.1.0 addresses:
- Missed AMAT-INTC sector correlation affecting an existing put credit spread
- Defaulted to Iron Condor for CSCO when Bull Put Spread had 100% historical PoP (CSCO was UP 8/8 quarters)
- Used IWM "June 20" expiration (a Saturday) instead of the correct "June 19" Friday monthly OPEX
- Reported CSCO implied move at 9.87% from a single source without cross-checking against Bloomberg's 5.8%

### v1.0.0 — Initial Release
- 16 skills, 5 agents, full multi-agent analysis orchestration
- PDF report generation (ReportLab)
- Stock screening, options strategy, portfolio analysis
